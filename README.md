# Functional Neural Network Control Chart

This repository contains R code and data from the Section "Case study: monitoring of HVAC systems on modern passenger trains" of the paper of Kulahci, Lepore, Palumbo, and Sposito "Functional neural network control chart". Note that this work was developed within the activities of the project ARS01_00861 “Integrated collaborative systems for smart factory - ICOSAF” coordinated by CRF (Centro Ricerche Fiat Scpa - www.crf.it) and financially supportedby MIUR (Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca). This repository contains the following files:

- Case_study_RScript.R contains the script performing all the analyses shown in Section 4 of the paper;
- PhaseIdata.RData contains the Phase I data set used to train the Functional Neural Network and estimate the control limits of the control chart;
- PhaseIIdata.RData contains the Phase II data set used to ass the practical applicability of the proposal to correctly signal an out-of-control state of an HVAC system.
