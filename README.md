# Functional Neural Network Control Chart

This repository contains R code and data from the Section "Case study: monitoring of HVAC systems on modern passenger trains" of the paper of Kulahci, Lepore, Palumbo, and Sposito "Functional neural network control chart". 
This repository contains the following files:

- Case_study_RScript.R contains the script performing all the analyses shown in Section 4 of the paper;
- PhaseIdata.RData contains the Phase I data set used to train the Functional Neural Network and estimate the control limits of the control chart;
- PhaseIIdata.RData contains the Phase II data set used to ass the practical applicability of the proposal to correctly signal an out-of-control state of an HVAC system.

 The HVAC data set is courtesy of the rail transportation company Hitachi Rail Italy (https://www.hitachirail.com/).
